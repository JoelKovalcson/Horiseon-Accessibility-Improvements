# Horiseon Accessibility Improvements

## Description

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

You can view the live project [here](https://joelkovalcson.github.io/Horiseon-Accessibility-Improvements/).

The "customer" for this website wanted to improve accessibility and formatting of the HTML and CSS pages. Specifically the guidelines stated that the following changes had to be made:
* Create a descriptive title element
* Use semantic sections in the HTML to provide more accessibility information
* Provide alt text for all image elements
* Clean up CSS to minimize duplication of styling selectors
* Maintain a logical ordering in the HTML and CSS that reflects each other

## What I Did

The first task I undertook was adding semantic elements in the HTML, both to accomplish the requirements and learn the flow and design of the webpage. After I was finished with semantic additions, the majority of changes came with modifying the CSS file to consolidate a decent number of classes. While doing this I reorganized the CSS and cleaned up unused classes in the HTML. After I was done with this I finished up by adding alt descriptors to images, a new title for the page, and fixed a broken nav link. During the changes I made, I added comments to describe sections where applicable.
